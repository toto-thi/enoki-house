# Enoki Mushroom Cultivation House üå±üçÑ

Automating Enoki mushroom growth with an IoT-based climate control system.

Growing Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) requires strict environmental control, including low `temperatures`, `high humidity`, and precise `CO‚ÇÇ` levels. Traditional cultivation methods often rely on manual adjustments, which can lead to inconsistent growth conditions, inefficient resource usage, and increased labor costs.

We propose an IoT-based automated cultivation system to streamline mushroom farming operations. By integrating real-time environmental monitoring and automated climate control, this system ensures optimal growing conditions with minimal manual intervention.

To demonstrate this approach, we simulate a controlled Enoki mushroom growing environment, where `temperature, humidity, and CO‚ÇÇ` sensors continuously feed data into an automation system built with `Node-RED`, `MQTT`, and `Python-based` simulations. The system automatically regulates humidifiers, ventilation, and temperature control devices based on sensor readings. Additionally, data is stored in `InfluxDB` and visualized in `Grafana`, allowing for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
